        "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain both data and methods that operate on the data. In OOP, software is structured around objects rather than actions, and data is organized around what it is rather than how it functions. This approach allows for code reusability, modularity, and scalability, making it easier to maintain and extend programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of OOP:\n",
        "1. **Classes**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the created objects will have.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Objects**: Instances of a class. An object is a specific realization of a class, containing real values for the attributes defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components for better control and security. This hides the internal workings of objects and only exposes necessary functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Inheritance**: A mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships. The class that inherits is called a subclass (or derived class), and the class being inherited from is the superclass (or base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Polymorphism**: The ability for objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstraction allows focusing on essential features while ignoring the irrelevant details.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example in Python:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Defining a class\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
        "        self.make = make  # Attribute\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "        self.year = year\n",
        "\n",
        "    def start_engine(self):  # Method\n",
        "        print(f\"The engine of the {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} is now running.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object (instance of the class)\n",

        "- **Modularity**: Code is organized into objects, making it easier to manage and understand.\n",
        "- **Reusability**: Classes and objects can be reused across different parts of a program or in other programs.\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Objects and classes can be extended or modified without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
        "- **Maintainability**: OOP encourages clear structure, which makes it easier to update or debug.\n",

It defines the **attributes** (data) and **methods** (functions) that the created objects (instances) will have. A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. The concept of a class allows programmers to model real-world objects and systems within their code.\n",

        "4. **Instance**: An individual object created using the blueprint of the class. Each instance can have its own values for the attributes defined by the class.\n",

        "### Example in Python:\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "### Important Points about Classes:\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: Classes provide encapsulation by bundling data and methods together and restricting direct access to some data using access modifiers (like private, public, etc.).\n",

        "- **Organization**: Classes allow for modular code organization by encapsulating related data and behavior.\n",
        "- **Reusability**: A class can be reused multiple times to create different objects without rewriting the code.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "- **Definition**: Abstraction is the concept of **hiding the complexity** and showing only the essential details of an object. It allows the user to focus on **what** the object does rather than **how** it does it.\n",
        "- **Purpose**: It simplifies the interface by providing only necessary information while concealing the implementation details.\n",
        "- **How it works**: In programming, abstraction is typically achieved using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**, where specific details are hidden from the user.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  - A car's driver doesn't need to understand the complexities of the engine to drive the car. They only need to know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **In Python:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Animal(ABC):  # Abstract class\n",
        "      @abstractmethod\n",

        "  my_dog = Dog()\n",
        "  print(my_dog.sound())  # Output: Bark\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  **Explanation**: The `Animal` class defines an abstract method `sound()` that is implemented in the `Dog` class. The user of the `Dog` class doesn't need to know how the sound is produced, just that it exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Encapsulation**:\n",
        "- **Definition**: Encapsulation is the concept of **bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions)** that operate on that data into a single unit (i.e., a class). It also includes the concept of **restricting access** to certain details by making attributes or methods private or protected.\n",
        "- **Purpose**: It provides **data protection** and control by allowing you to hide certain parts of an object from the outside world and exposing only the necessary information.\n",
        "- **How it works**: In Python, encapsulation is implemented using **private** or **protected** access modifiers, where private variables and methods are not accessible directly outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  - A bank account object may hide its balance from external users, allowing them to deposit or withdraw but not directly manipulate the balance.\n",

        "  # print(account.__balance)  # This will raise an AttributeError\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  **Explanation**: In the `BankAccount` class, `__balance` is a private variable. It is encapsulated within the class and can only be accessed through methods like `deposit()` and `get_balance()`.\n",

        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Parent:\n",

It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The concept promotes flexibility in code by enabling a single interface to represent multiple types of behaviors, depending on the object.\n",

        "### **Key Concepts of Polymorphism**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Method Overriding**: Polymorphism is typically achieved through **method overriding**, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass overrides the method in the parent class, allowing the subclass to define its behavior for the method.\n",

        "2. **Method Overloading**: In some languages (though not in Python), polymorphism can also be implemented using **method overloading**, where multiple methods have the same name but differ in their parameter types or count. In Python, this is usually handled by default arguments or dynamic typing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Duck Typing**: In Python, polymorphism is often implemented using **duck typing**, which means that if an object behaves like a certain type (i.e., it has the methods and properties expected of that type), it can be treated as that type without explicitly inheriting from a specific class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example of Polymorphism in Python**:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Method Overriding**:\n",
        "In this example, the `speak()` method is overridden in different subclasses, and polymorphism allows calling the same method (`speak()`) on different types of objects (Dog and Cat), with each object responding differently.\n",

        "# Parent class (superclass)\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Duck Typing**:\n",
        "Duck typing is a form of polymorphism in Python where an object's behavior is determined by its methods and properties, not its actual type. If an object \"acts like\" another object, it can be used in its place.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def move(self):\n",
        "        return \"Car is moving\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Airplane:\n",
        "    def move(self):\n",
        "        return \"Airplane is flying\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Function demonstrating polymorphism through duck typing\n",
        "def start_movement(vehicle):\n",
        "    print(vehicle.move())\n",

        "start_movement(plane)  # Output: Airplane is flying\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, both `Car` and `Airplane` have a `move()` method, even though they do not share a common superclass. The `start_movement()` function works for both because of duck typing: \"if it moves like a vehicle, treat it as a vehicle.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Types of Polymorphism**:\n",
        "1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**: Achieved via **method overloading** or **operator overloading** in some languages, but Python doesn't support method overloading directly. Instead, Python allows default arguments or variable-length arguments to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**: Achieved via **method overriding** where a method in a subclass overrides a method in its parent class. The actual method that is called is determined at runtime based on the object's type.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Operator Overloading** (A Form of Polymorphism):\n",
        "In Python, polymorphism can also be seen in operator overloading, where built-in operators behave differently based on the type of object they are used with.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Using + operator on integers\n",
        "print(3 + 5)  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using + operator on strings\n",
        "print(\"Hello \" + \"World\")  # Output: Hello World\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using * operator on lists\n",
        "print([1, 2] * 2)  # Output: [1, 2, 1, 2]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the `+` and `*` operators behave differently depending on the type of objects they operate on, demonstrating polymorphism in Python's operator behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Advantages of Polymorphism**:\n",
        "1. **Flexibility**: Polymorphism allows for the same method to be used on different objects, making the code flexible and reusable.\n",
        "2. **Code Readability**: The same interface can represent different behaviors, making code cleaner and easier to understand.\n",
        "3. **Extensibility**: It becomes easier to extend the application by adding new classes without changing existing code, following the Open-Closed Principle.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion**:\n",
        "Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their unique ways. In Python, it is mainly achieved through method overriding and duck typing, making the code flexible, maintainable, and scalable."

        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), where the internal details of an object are hidden from the outside world and only a controlled interface is provided to interact with the object. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the data and ensures that only intended operations can be performed on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Encapsulation is Achieved in Python:\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers and defining attributes or methods as public, protected, or private. Python provides the following mechanisms to control access:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Public Members**:\n",
        "   - Public members are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.\n",
        "   - Any attribute or method defined without an underscore (`_`) is public by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, brand):\n",
        "           self.brand = brand  # public attribute\n",
        "       \n",
        "       def drive(self):  # public method\n",
        "           print(f\"{self.brand} is driving\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   car = Car(\"Toyota\")\n",
        "   print(car.brand)  # Accessing public attribute\n",
        "   car.drive()       # Accessing public method\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Protected Members**:\n",
        "   - Protected members are intended to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "   - In Python, protected members are denoted by a single underscore (`_`) before the name of the attribute or method.\n",
        "   - Although Python doesn't enforce strict access control, it's a convention to indicate that these members are meant to be treated as internal.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, brand):\n",
        "           self._brand = brand  # protected attribute\n",
        "       \n",
        "       def _drive(self):  # protected method\n",
        "           print(f\"{self._brand} is driving\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   car = Car(\"Honda\")\n",
        "   print(car._brand)  # Not recommended but still accessible\n",
        "   car._drive()       # Not recommended but still accessible\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Private Members**:\n",
        "   - Private members are intended to be accessible only within the class where they are defined.\n",
        "   - In Python, private members are denoted by a double underscore (`__`) before the name of the attribute or method.\n",
        "   - Python uses name mangling to make these attributes harder to access from outside the class. The interpreter changes the name of the private member to `_ClassName__attributeName`.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, brand, speed):\n",

        "       \n",
        "       def __drive(self):  # private method\n",
        "           print(f\"{self.__brand} is driving at {self.__speed} mph\")\n",
        "\n",
        "       def start(self):  # public method to access private members\n",
        "           self.__drive()\n",
        "\n",
        "   car = Car(\"Tesla\", 80)\n",
        "   car.start()  # Accessing private method through public method\n",
        "   # car.__drive()  # This will raise an AttributeError\n",
        "   # print(car.__brand)  # This will raise an AttributeError\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Accessing private members through name mangling (not recommended)\n",
        "   print(car._Car__brand)  # Output: Tesla\n",
        "   car._Car__drive()       # Output: Tesla is driving at 80 mph\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Encapsulation through Getters and Setters:\n",
        "To provide controlled access to private attributes, Python allows the use of **getter** and **setter** methods. These methods act as an interface to retrieve or modify the private attributes while applying any additional logic if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",

        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Setter method to modify the private attribute with validation\n",
        "    def set_balance(self, amount):\n",
        "        if amount > 0:\n",
        "            self.__balance = amount\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            print(\"Invalid amount\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an instance and accessing private attributes via getter and setter\n",
        "account = BankAccount(1000)\n",
        "print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000\n",
        "\n",
        "account.set_balance(2000)\n",
        "print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 2000\n",
        "\n",
        "account.set_balance(-500)  # Invalid amount\n",
        "```\n",

        "### Method Overriding in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method Overriding** is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a **subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass**. When the method in the subclass has the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the superclass, the method in the subclass overrides the one in the superclass. This allows the subclass to provide its own behavior while still inheriting the overall structure of the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Points of Method Overriding:\n",
        "1. **Same Method Name**: The method name in the subclass must be the same as in the superclass.\n",
        "2. **Same Signature**: The method should have the same number and types of arguments as the method in the superclass.\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: Method overriding only works in the context of inheritance, where a subclass inherits from a superclass.\n",
        "4. **Runtime Behavior**: Method overriding is resolved at runtime, meaning the version of the method that is called depends on the type of the object that is being referred to at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of Method Overriding:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Superclass\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"This animal makes a sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Subclass\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"The dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Subclass\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"The cat meows\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating objects\n",
        "animal = Animal()\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling the overridden method\n",
        "animal.sound()  # Output: This animal makes a sound\n",
        "dog.sound()     # Output: The dog barks\n",
        "cat.sound()     # Output: The cat meows\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above example:\n",
        "- The `sound()` method is defined in the superclass `Animal`.\n",
        "- The subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` both override the `sound()` method to provide their own specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Use Method Overriding?\n",
        "1. **Customization**: It allows the subclass to change or extend the behavior of methods inherited from the superclass without modifying the superclass code.\n",
        "2. **Polymorphism**: Method overriding enables **polymorphism**, where the same method can behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of Polymorphism via Method Overriding:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def animal_sound(animal):\n",
        "    animal.sound()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Passing different objects\n",
        "animal_sound(Animal())  # Output: This animal makes a sound\n",
        "animal_sound(Dog())     # Output: The dog barks\n",
        "animal_sound(Cat())     # Output: The cat meows\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the `animal_sound()` function calls the `sound()` method, and the correct version of the method is determined by the object passed in (`Dog` or `Cat`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Overriding vs Overloading:\n",
        "- **Method Overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (as discussed above).\n",
        "- **Method Overloading** allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters (not directly supported in Python, but can be simulated with default arguments or `*args`/`**kwargs`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using `super()` to Call Superclass Method:\n",
        "Sometimes, you may want to call the superclass's version of the overridden method inside the subclass. This can be done using `super()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"This animal makes a sound\")\n",

        "        super().sound()  # Calls the superclass method\n",
        "        print(\"The dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",

        "This animal makes a sound\n",
        "The dog barks\n",

        "\n",
        "In this case, the `super().sound()` call in the subclass allows the `sound()` method of the superclass (`Animal`) to execute before the subclass-specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Method Overriding** allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.\n",

        "3. **Deleter**: The `@age.deleter` decorator allows deletion of the `age` attribute when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of `@property`:\n",
        "- **Encapsulation**: It hides the internal implementation of getting and setting attribute values, providing controlled access to the attributes.\n",
        "- **Cleaner Syntax**: It allows access to attributes without using explicit getter and setter methods, making the code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "- **Validation**: You can add validation logic when setting attribute values (e.g., ensuring age is non-negative in the above example).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Without `@property`:\n",
        "Without `@property`, you would have to explicitly call getter and setter methods like `p.get_age()` and `p.set_age(35)`, which is less clean and intuitive than using attribute-like access.\n",

        "### Importance of Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism** is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It is the ability of different objects to respond in their own way to the same method call. This concept is important for the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Code Reusability**\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows you to reuse existing code without modifying it. A common interface or method can work with different types of objects, reducing the need for code duplication. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       def sound(self):\n",
        "           pass\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "       def sound(self):\n",
        "           return \"Woof\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "       def sound(self):\n",
        "           return \"Meow\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   def make_sound(animal):\n",
        "       print(animal.sound())\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Reusability with different objects\n",
        "   dog = Dog()\n",
        "   cat = Cat()\n",
        "   make_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof\n",
        "   make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Flexibility**\n",
        "   - Polymorphism provides flexibility in programming by allowing the same method or function to behave differently based on the object that invokes it. This reduces tight coupling between components and makes it easier to extend or change the code in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Shape:\n",
        "       def area(self):\n",
        "           pass\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
        "       def __init__(self, length, width):\n",
        "           self.length = length\n",
        "           self.width = width\n",
        "           \n",
        "       def area(self):\n",
        "           return self.length * self.width\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Circle(Shape):\n",
        "       def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "           self.radius = radius\n",
        "           \n",
        "       def area(self):\n",
        "           return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
        "\n",
        "   shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3)]\n",
        "\n",
        "   for shape in shapes:\n",
        "       print(shape.area())  # Output: 20 (for Rectangle), 28.26 (for Circle)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Ease of Maintenance and Extensibility**\n",
        "   - Polymorphism enables you to add new types or extend existing functionality without altering existing code. This improves maintainability and helps you avoid large-scale changes when introducing new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   - If you want to add a new type of `Shape` (e.g., `Triangle`), you simply define a new class with an `area()` method, and it can be used with existing code that relies on polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Supports Overriding and Overloading**\n",
        "   - **Method Overriding** allows subclasses to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This enables polymorphic behavior where the same method name can act differently depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "   - **Method Overloading** (though not supported natively in Python as it is in some other languages) allows multiple methods to be defined with the same name but different parameters. This is another form of polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Improved Readability and Organization**\n",
        "   - By allowing classes to share common interfaces and behaviors, polymorphism helps in organizing code more effectively. This makes programs easier to read, understand, and organize by separating concerns.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Dynamic Binding**\n",
        "   - With polymorphism, method calls are dynamically bound at runtime, meaning that the correct method is chosen based on the object instance. This allows flexibility in deciding how to handle various object types during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "Polymorphism is crucial in OOP because it promotes flexibility, maintainability, and scalability. By allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same method calls in their own way, polymorphism enhances code reusability, reduces code duplication, and enables easy extension of functionality without modifying existing code. This leads to cleaner, more efficient, and organized code that is easier to maintain and scale."

        "### Abstract Class in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "An **abstract class** in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes are used to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring that the derived classes provide specific functionality for those methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides the `abc` (Abstract Base Classes) module to define abstract classes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features of Abstract Classes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cannot be Instantiated**:\n",
        "   - You cannot create an object of an abstract class. It only provides a structure for subclasses.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Abstract Methods**:\n",
        "   - An abstract class can have abstract methods (methods without any implementation). Subclasses must provide the implementation for these abstract methods.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Subclassing**:\n",
        "   - Any class inheriting from an abstract class must implement all of its abstract methods. If a subclass does not implement these methods, it will also be considered abstract.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Partial Implementation**:\n",
        "   - Abstract classes can also have methods with full implementations, and subclasses can inherit these methods. Only abstract methods need to be overridden by the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How to Define an Abstract Class:\n",
        "\n",
        "To define an abstract class, you need to import the `ABC` class from the `abc` module and decorate abstract methods with `@abstractmethod`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "# Abstract Class\n",
        "class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "    \n",
        "    # Abstract method (no implementation)\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",

        "\n",
        "# Subclass (Cat) implementing the abstract method\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    \n",

        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        return \"Meow\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating instances of the subclasses\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using the subclass implementations\n",
        "print(dog.sound())  # Output: Woof\n",
        "print(cat.sound())  # Output: Meow\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using the inherited method from the abstract class\n",
        "dog.eat()  # Output: This animal is eating.\n",
        "cat.eat()  # Output: This animal is eating.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Trying to instantiate the abstract class will raise an error\n",
        "# animal = Animal()  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Animal with abstract methods sound\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Use Abstract Classes?\n",
        "1. **Enforcing a Contract**: Abstract classes enforce that derived classes must implement certain methods. This ensures that all subclasses follow a specific structure.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be implemented in the abstract class and inherited by all subclasses, reducing code duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation of Incomplete Functionality**: Abstract classes allow you to encapsulate some common functionality while leaving parts of the implementation to subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "Abstract classes in Python are useful when you want to define a template for other classes and enforce the implementation of specific methods in subclasses. They help ensure that the subclasses provide the necessary behavior while allowing for partial implementation in the abstract class itself."

        "### Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several key advantages that make it a popular programming paradigm for building complex and maintainable software systems. Below are some of the primary benefits of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Modularity and Reusability**\n",
        "   - **Modularity**: OOP allows you to break down a large program into smaller, manageable pieces, known as objects or classes. This modularity makes it easier to understand, develop, and maintain the code.\n",
        "   - **Reusability**: By using inheritance, you can reuse existing classes to create new ones with added or modified functionality. This reduces redundancy and promotes efficient code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "   - **Encapsulation** refers to bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, a class. It allows for better control over data and keeps it safe from unintended interference or misuse.\n",
        "   - Through encapsulation, you can hide internal object details from the outside world, exposing only what is necessary (public methods) and protecting internal data (private attributes). This ensures data integrity and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Abstraction**\n",
        "   - OOP allows for **abstraction**, which simplifies complex systems by showing only essential features and hiding unnecessary details. Abstracting the functionality into methods allows users to interact with objects at a higher level, without needing to understand how they work internally.\n",
        "   - This reduces complexity and allows developers to focus on the interactions and behavior of objects rather than the inner workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Inheritance**\n",
        "   - **Inheritance** enables you to create new classes based on existing ones. The new class (child class) inherits attributes and behaviors (methods) from the parent class, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.\n",
        "   - It also allows for the creation of more specialized classes from general ones, providing flexibility and ease of maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "   - **Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It means that the same method name can be used in different contexts (with different implementations), making the code more flexible and extensible.\n",
        "   - For example, you can use the same interface (method name) for different objects, and each object can respond in its own way, based on its class type.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Maintainability**\n",
        "   - OOP structures programs in a way that makes them easier to maintain. Since objects are self-contained, making changes in one part of the codebase is less likely to affect unrelated areas. The modular structure allows for easy debugging, testing, and updates.\n",
        "   - By using inheritance and encapsulation, the need to rewrite code is minimized, and existing functionality can be easily extended.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7. **Scalability**\n",
        "   - As the size and complexity of an application increase, OOP makes it easier to manage the growing codebase. Since classes are independent modules, scaling the application by adding new features or changing existing functionality becomes easier.\n",
        "   - OOP's use of abstraction, modularity, and code reuse helps developers build scalable software systems that grow without becoming overly complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 8. **Flexibility and Extensibility**\n",
        "   - OOP allows developers to build flexible and extensible systems where objects can be easily modified, extended, or replaced without significant changes to the entire codebase.\n",
        "   - By following the OOP principles, you can introduce new object types or behaviors without affecting the existing system, leading to more adaptable programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 9. **Data Security**\n",
        "   - Encapsulation in OOP ensures that objects manage their own state and internal data is protected from outside access. Private attributes can only be accessed or modified through public methods, which control how the data is manipulated.\n",
        "   - This leads to greater data security and prevents accidental or unauthorized modifications to an object’s data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 10. **Improved Collaboration**\n",
        "   - OOP encourages the division of labor in development teams. Developers can work on different objects or classes independently, reducing conflicts and improving productivity.\n",
        "   - The modular nature of OOP makes it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on different parts of the application simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "OOP provides a structured, modular approach to software development. It promotes code reuse, security, flexibility, and maintainability, which are key for building complex and large-scale applications. By using core concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism, developers can create systems that are both efficient and easy to manage."

        "### Key Concepts in Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "1. **Code Reuse**: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit methods and properties from multiple parent classes, reducing code duplication.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Python uses a specific order to determine which method or attribute to inherit if there are name conflicts between parent classes. This order is called the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** and follows the C3 Linearization algorithm.\n",
        "   - You can view the MRO of a class using the `mro()` method:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     print(Car.mro())\n",
        "     # Output: [<class '__main__.Car'>, <class '__main__.Vehicle'>, <class '__main__.Engine'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Potential for Conflicts**: In cases where parent classes have methods or attributes with the same name, the MRO determines the order in which Python checks the parent classes to find the method or attribute. The first match found is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Show method from class A\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class B:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Show method from class B\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A, B):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "obj = C()\n",
        "obj.show()  # Output: Show method from class A\n",
        "```\n",
        "Here, `class C` inherits from both `A` and `B`. Since `A` is listed first, Python calls the `show()` method from `A`, following the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "- **Code Reusability**: It allows a class to reuse code from multiple parent classes, reducing duplication.\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: You can mix different features from multiple classes to create more complex or specialized behavior in the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Disadvantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "- **Complexity**: It can lead to confusion, especially when the base classes have methods or attributes with the same name.\n",
        "- **Name Conflicts**: If multiple parent classes have methods with the same name, it can be challenging to manage method resolution and avoid conflicts.\n",

        "The `super()` function in Python is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or superclass from within a subclass. It is especially useful in the context of inheritance and method overriding. The `super()` function allows you to call a method from the parent class in the child class, ensuring that the parent class's method is properly executed alongside any additional behavior defined in the subclass.\n",

        "1. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: `super()` follows the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. It ensures that in a multiple inheritance scenario, the correct method in the parent classes is invoked according to the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Avoids Hardcoding the Parent Class**: Using `super()` is better than explicitly naming the parent class because it makes your code more maintainable. If you change the name of the parent class or the class hierarchy, you don't need to manually update method calls everywhere.\n",

        "Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, enabling methods to behave differently based on the object's actual class. This is one of the key features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and is commonly implemented through inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Polymorphism Works with Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Method Overriding**: Polymorphism in Python often works through method overriding in inheritance. A subclass can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When the method is called on an instance of the subclass, the subclass's version of the method is executed, even if the method is called through a reference to the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Method Dispatch**: In Python, the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the type of the object. This dynamic binding is what makes polymorphism flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Polymorphism with Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "In this example:\n",

        "- The `Dog` and `Cat` classes override the `speak()` method with their own implementations.\n",
        "- The function `animal_sound()` takes an object of any subclass of `Animal` and calls its `speak()` method. Depending on whether a `Dog` or `Cat` object is passed, the corresponding overridden method is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points of Polymorphism in Python:\n",
        "- **Method Overriding**: Subclasses can override superclass methods to provide specific behavior.\n",
        "- **Dynamic Typing**: In Python, objects are dynamically typed, so the actual method that gets executed is determined by the object type at runtime.\n",
        "- **Same Interface, Different Behavior**: Objects of different classes (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`) can be treated as instances of the superclass (`Animal`), and their specific implementations of a method can be executed based on their actual class.\n",

        "    print(f\"Area: {shape.area()}\")\n",

        "- The `area()` method is overridden in both subclasses.\n",
        "- Using polymorphism, we can call the `area()` method on different objects (`Rectangle`, `Circle`) and get the appropriate result for each.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
        "- **Code Reusability**: A single function can work with different types of objects.\n",
        "- **Extensibility**: New subclasses with specific behavior can be added without modifying the base class or the code that works with it.\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Polymorphism allows for implementing generalized code that can interact with various object types, leading to more maintainable and scalable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "Polymorphism, combined with inheritance, allows methods in a base class to be overridden by subclasses, ensuring that the correct method is called at runtime based on the actual object's class. This enables Python programs to handle different types of objects through a common interface, making code more flexible and reusable."
