        "\n",
        "#### **Advantages:**\n",
        "✔ **Faster Execution** – The program is translated before execution, so it runs quickly.  \n",

        "**Logging** in Python is the process of tracking events that occur when some software runs. By recording these events, developers can understand what the code is doing and identify issues that arise. The Python **`logging`** module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs, allowing developers to record diagnostic information, monitor program flow, and troubleshoot errors.\n",

        "2. **Error Tracking**: Logging can record exceptions and errors for later analysis, especially for production systems where printing errors to the console isn't practical.\n",
        "3. **Audit and Record Keeping**: Logs can serve as a record of important events, such as user actions, transactions, or system changes.\n",

        "### Handling Multiple Exceptions in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions in several ways depending on how you want to manage them. Here are the most common methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Using Multiple `except` Blocks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can handle different types of exceptions separately by using multiple `except` blocks. This allows you to specify different actions for each type of exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
        "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / num\n",
        "\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    # Handling ValueError (e.g., if input is not an integer)\n",
        "    print(\"This is not a valid number.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    # Handling ZeroDivisionError (e.g., if input is zero)\n",
        "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
        "\n",

        "    # Generic catch for any other exceptions\n",
        "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- If the user enters a non-integer, the `ValueError` block is executed.\n",
        "- If the user enters `0`, the `ZeroDivisionError` block is executed.\n",
        "- Any other unexpected error is handled by the generic `Exception` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Using a Single `except` Block for Multiple Exceptions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can group multiple exceptions together in a single `except` block by specifying them as a tuple. This is useful if you want to handle different exceptions in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / num\n",

        "    # Handling both ValueError and ZeroDivisionError\n",
        "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- Both `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError` are handled by the same block.\n",
        "- The variable `e` will hold the error message for whichever exception is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Catching All Exceptions Using `Exception`:**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to catch all possible exceptions without distinguishing between types, you can use a single `except` block with the base `Exception` class. However, this is usually not recommended unless you have a very good reason because it makes debugging harder.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / num\n",

        "    print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- This block will catch all exceptions, including custom and built-in exceptions.\n",
        "- It can be useful when you want to ensure that an exception is caught, but it’s usually better to catch specific exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Using `finally` with Multiple Exceptions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can combine multiple `except` blocks with a `finally` block. The `finally` block contains code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This is useful for cleaning up resources, like closing files or database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",

        "    print(\"This block will always be executed.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- The `finally` block will run after the `try` and `except` blocks, whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Using `else` with `try-except`:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `else` block can be used with `try-except` to specify code that should only be executed if no exceptions were raised. This can make your code more organized by separating successful execution from error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",

        "\n",
        "The `with` statement in Python is primarily used for **resource management** and **exception handling**, particularly when dealing with files. It ensures that resources like file objects are properly acquired and released, even in the event of an error or exception. The main advantage of using the `with` statement when handling files is that it **automatically closes the file** once the block of code under the `with` statement is executed, which eliminates the need to explicitly call `file.close()`.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Automatic File Closure**:\n",
        "   - When you use `with`, Python ensures that the file is closed automatically when the block is exited, regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",
        "   - Without `with`, if you forget to close the file, it can lead to memory leaks or other resource issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cleaner Code**:\n",
        "   - The `with` statement simplifies file handling by reducing the amount of code. It handles the resource acquisition and release for you, making the code more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Exception Safety**:\n",
        "   - Even if an error or exception occurs inside the `with` block, the file will still be closed properly. This reduces the risk of leaving files open accidentally.\n",

        "  - `as file`: The file object is assigned to the variable `file`.\n",
        "  - Once the block inside the `with` statement finishes, the file is automatically closed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Logging is an essential practice in software development, and it provides several benefits for maintaining and debugging programs. Here are the main advantages of using logging in a program:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Easier Debugging and Problem Diagnosis:**\n",
        "   - Logging allows developers to track events and program flow, helping them **diagnose issues** without requiring user intervention.\n",
        "   - Instead of printing debug messages, **logs capture detailed information** like variable values, error occurrences, and system state at different stages of execution.\n",
        "   - This makes it easier to identify the **root cause of bugs** and performance bottlenecks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Error Tracking and Monitoring:**\n",
        "   - Logs can capture **error messages** and **exceptions** as they happen, enabling developers to monitor the stability of their applications.\n",
        "   - This allows for the identification of **unexpected behaviors** and recurring issues, even in production environments, where debugging with tools may not be feasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Helps in Analyzing Application Behavior:**\n",
        "   - Logging provides insights into how the application is being used and helps analyze its behavior over time.\n",
        "   - It offers data about **performance, usage patterns, and system loads**, making it useful for **performance tuning** and understanding user interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Persistent Record for Post-mortem Analysis:**\n",
        "   - Logs are typically stored in **files** or other persistent storage formats, providing a historical record of program activity.\n",
        "   - This is useful for **post-mortem analysis** when an issue arises, as the logs provide a trace of the events leading up to the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Improves Security and Compliance:**\n",
        "   - **Security logs** can be used to record login attempts, user activities, or suspicious behaviors, helping detect and mitigate security breaches.\n",
        "   - Logging also aids in ensuring **compliance** with regulations that require detailed **audit trails** of system events and access.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. Provides Granular Control with Log Levels:**\n",
        "   - Most logging frameworks offer multiple **log levels** (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing developers to control the **verbosity** of their logging output.\n",
        "   - In production, only critical errors may be logged, while in development, detailed debug information can be logged.\n",

        "\n",
        "Memory management in Python involves the process of **allocating, using, and releasing memory** efficiently during the execution of programs. Python’s memory management system is designed to optimize memory usage and ensure that resources are used effectively, without the need for developers to manage memory manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s an overview of how memory management works in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Automatic Memory Management:**\n",
        "   - Python provides **automatic memory management** via **dynamic memory allocation** and **garbage collection**. Developers don’t need to manually allocate or free memory, as Python handles memory allocation and deallocation under the hood.\n",
        "   - When an object (e.g., a variable, list, or class instance) is created, memory is automatically allocated for it. When that object is no longer needed, Python’s garbage collector automatically reclaims that memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Memory Allocation:**\n",
        "   Python uses various memory regions to manage objects:\n",
        "   - **Stack Memory**: Used for storing function calls, local variables, and control flow. The stack is responsible for managing the scope of variables within functions.\n",
        "   - **Heap Memory**: All Python objects (such as lists, dictionaries, and class instances) are stored in the heap. The heap memory is dynamically allocated and is much larger than the stack. The **heap** is managed by the Python memory manager and garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Python’s Memory Manager:**\n",
        "   Python has a built-in **memory manager** responsible for handling memory-related tasks. This manager:\n",
        "   - Allocates memory for Python objects and manages object lifetimes.\n",
        "   - Reclaims memory once an object is no longer in use.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It operates at different layers:\n",
        "   - **Object-Specific Allocators**: These are optimizations that allocate memory for objects of a specific type (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).\n",
        "   - **General-Purpose Allocators**: Responsible for allocating memory blocks for any Python object.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Reference Counting:**\n",
        "   Python uses a **reference counting mechanism** to track the number of references to an object. Each object has an internal reference count that keeps track of how many variables or structures refer to it.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Incrementing Reference Count**: When a new reference is created to an object, the reference count increases.\n",
        "   - **Decrementing Reference Count**: When a reference is deleted (e.g., using `del` or when it goes out of scope), the reference count decreases.\n",
        "   - **Garbage Collection**: If an object’s reference count drops to **zero**, meaning no references point to the object, Python immediately deallocates the memory for that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Garbage Collection (GC):**\n",
        "   - While reference counting is the primary mechanism for memory management, it may fail in the presence of **circular references** (where objects reference each other but are no longer used by the program).\n",
        "   - To handle these cases, Python employs an additional **garbage collector**. This garbage collector is responsible for identifying and collecting objects involved in **reference cycles**.\n",
        "   - The garbage collector runs automatically but can be manually triggered using the `gc` module if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. Memory Optimization:**\n",
        "   Python has several optimizations to manage memory more efficiently:\n",
        "   - **Small Object Allocator (PyMalloc)**: Python uses an internal allocator called **PyMalloc** for managing small objects (like integers, floats, and short strings). PyMalloc reduces the overhead of frequently creating and deleting small objects.\n",
        "   - **Object Pools**: Python reuses memory from **object pools** to optimize performance. For example, small integers and short strings are cached and reused to avoid frequent allocations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **7. Memory Leaks:**\n",
        "   Although Python has automatic memory management, **memory leaks** can still occur if objects persist in memory unnecessarily (e.g., due to unexpected references).\n",
        "   - Memory leaks are typically caused by objects remaining referenced even though they are no longer needed, preventing the garbage collector from freeing the associated memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **8. Manual Memory Management:**\n",
        "   Although Python manages memory automatically, developers can interact with memory management functions:\n",
        "   - **`gc` module**: Allows developers to manually trigger garbage collection and inspect memory usage.\n",
        "   - **`del` keyword**: Deletes references to objects, potentially reducing their reference count and allowing them to be garbage-collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion:**\n",
        "Memory management in Python is largely automatic, using reference counting, garbage collection, and optimizations like the small object allocator. These features make memory management easy and efficient for developers, though understanding how Python handles memory under the hood helps in writing optimized and memory-efficient code."

        "\n",
        "**Key Concepts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Reference Counting:** This is the primary mechanism used by Python's garbage collector.\n",
        "    * Each object in Python has a reference count, which keeps track of the number of variables or data structures that refer to that object.\n",
        "    * When a reference to an object is created (e.g., assigning the object to a variable), its reference count is incremented.\n",
        "    * When a reference is deleted (e.g., reassigning a variable), the reference count is decremented.\n",
        "    * If an object's reference count drops to zero, it means there are no longer any variables or data structures pointing to it. In this case, the garbage collector automatically reclaims the memory occupied by that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Cycle Detection:**\n",
        "    * Reference counting alone cannot handle circular references. For example, if two objects hold references to each other, their reference counts might never reach zero, even if they are no longer accessible from the rest of the program.\n",
        "    * To address this, Python uses a cycle-detecting garbage collector. This collector periodically scans the memory for objects that are involved in circular references and reclaims them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works (Simplified):**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Object Creation:** When you create an object (e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`), the Python interpreter allocates memory for the object and initializes its reference count to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reference Changes:** As you use the object, its reference count may change. For example:\n",
        "    - `another_list = my_list` (reference count of `my_list` increases to 2)\n",
        "    - `my_list = None` (reference count of the original list decreases to 1, as `my_list` now points to `None`)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Garbage Collection:**\n",
        "    - When the reference count of an object reaches zero, the garbage collector reclaims the memory occupied by that object.\n",
        "    - Periodically, the cycle-detecting garbage collector runs to identify and reclaim objects involved in circular references.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **CPU-bound tasks:** If your application involves tasks that heavily utilize the CPU (e.g., complex calculations, image processing), creating multiple threads allows you to leverage multiple CPU cores. This can significantly speed up the overall execution time by performing tasks concurrently.\n",

        "**2. Improved Responsiveness:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **I/O-bound tasks:** If your application deals with I/O operations (e.g., network requests, file reading/writing), threads can prevent your program from becoming unresponsive.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Multithreading enables you to simulate concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single process.\n",

        "* In some cases, multithreading can provide a simpler way to structure your code than using multiple processes.\n",
        "* Sharing data between threads within the same process can sometimes be easier than inter-process communication.\n",

        "**However, it's important to note that multithreading can also introduce challenges:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Race conditions:** Multiple threads accessing and modifying shared resources can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption.\n",
        "* **Deadlocks:** Threads can become blocked waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a deadlock situation where no thread can proceed.\n",
        "* **Synchronization overhead:** Managing thread synchronization (using locks, semaphores, etc.) can add overhead and complexity to your code.\n",

        "In Python, the `logging` module allows you to log messages at different severity levels. The most commonly used levels are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "2. **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
        "3. **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future.\n",
        "4. **ERROR**: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
        "5. **CRITICAL**: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to log at different levels\n",
