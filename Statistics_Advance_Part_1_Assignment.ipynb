For continuous distributions, probabilities are assigned to **intervals** of values rather than specific points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key details about PDF:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Characteristics of PDF:\n",
        "1. **Definition**: The PDF is a function, denoted as $ f(x) $, that describes the probability density of a continuous random variable $ X $. While the PDF itself does not give the probability of $ X $ taking a specific value (since that probability is always 0 for continuous variables), it is used to calculate the probability that $ X $ falls within an interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Properties**:\n",
        "   - **Non-negativity**: The PDF is always non-negative: $ f(x) \\geq 0 $ for all $ x $.\n",
        "   - **Total Area Under Curve**: The total area under the curve of the PDF across all possible values must equal 1. Mathematically:\n",

        "      $P(a \\leq X \\leq b)$ = $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$\n",

        "     The value of the PDF at any specific point $ f(x) $ is not a probability itself, but rather a \"density\" that helps determine the probability over an interval.\n",

        "3. **Shape**: The shape of a PDF can vary depending on the distribution. For example, the PDF of a **normal distribution** is the classic \"bell curve,\" while the PDF of an **exponential distribution** has a steep drop-off.\n",

        "This function describes a **bell-shaped curve** where most of the data is concentrated around the mean $ \\mu $, and the likelihood decreases symmetrically as you move away from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Notes:\n",
        "- The PDF can take on values greater than 1 for some ranges (e.g., for distributions with small variance), but the **area** under the curve between two points represents the probability, and the total area must always sum to 1.\n",
        "- For discrete random variables, the equivalent concept is the **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**, which gives the probability of specific outcomes, rather than densities over intervals.\n",

        "A **normal distribution**, also known as the **Gaussian distribution**, is a continuous probability distribution characterized by a symmetric, bell-shaped curve. It is one of the most important distributions in statistics and is widely used in various fields to model natural phenomena, measurement errors, and standardized test scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Characteristics of a Normal Distribution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Bell-Shaped Curve**:\n",
        "   The normal distribution has a characteristic bell-shaped curve that is symmetric around the mean. The shape indicates that most of the data points are clustered around the center (mean) and the frequency of occurrences decreases as you move away from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Symmetry**:\n",
        "   A normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical around its mean. This means the left and right halves of the curve are mirror images of each other. As a result, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mean, Median, and Mode**:\n",
        "   For a normal distribution, the **mean** (average), **median** (middle value), and **mode** (most frequent value) are all equal and located at the peak of the curve. These measures of central tendency are identical because of the symmetry.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Asymptotic**:\n",
        "   The tails of a normal distribution extend infinitely in both directions, getting closer and closer to the horizontal axis but never touching it. This means that there is a non-zero probability of extreme values, but the probability becomes very small as the values move farther from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Defined by Two Parameters**:\n",
        "   A normal distribution is defined by two parameters:\n",
        "   - **Mean (μ)**: The location parameter that determines the center of the distribution.\n",
        "   - **Standard Deviation (σ)**: The spread or scale parameter that measures the width of the distribution. A larger standard deviation results in a wider, flatter curve, while a smaller standard deviation produces a narrower, steeper curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule)**:\n",
        "   The **empirical rule** is a rule of thumb that describes the percentage of data that lies within certain intervals in a normal distribution:\n",
        "   - Approximately **68%** of the data falls within one standard deviation (σ) of the mean (μ).\n",
        "   - Approximately **95%** of the data falls within two standard deviations (σ) of the mean (μ).\n",
        "   - Approximately **99.7%** of the data falls within three standard deviations (σ) of the mean (μ).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Unimodal**:\n",
        "   A normal distribution has a single peak, making it **unimodal**. This means there is only one value that has the highest frequency (mode).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **No Skewness**:\n",
        "   Since a normal distribution is perfectly symmetric, it has no skewness (skewness = 0). The left and right tails of the distribution have the same length and height, indicating that there is no bias toward higher or lower values.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Kurtosis**:\n",
        "   A normal distribution has a kurtosis value of 3 (sometimes referred to as \"mesokurtic\"). This indicates that the tails of the distribution are neither too heavy nor too light compared to other distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Total Area Under the Curve**:\n",
        "    The total area under the probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is always equal to 1. This reflects the fact that the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes must equal 1.\n",

        "The standard normal distribution is essential in statistics for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Z-Scores and Standardization**:\n",
        "   One of the most important uses of the standard normal distribution is to calculate **Z-scores**. A **Z-score** is the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a normal distribution. It is calculated as:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   $\n",

        "   - $\\mu$ is the mean of the population,\n",
        "   - $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   By converting a normal distribution into a standard normal distribution (standardizing it), we can easily compare different datasets or determine probabilities for any normally distributed data. Z-scores allow us to interpret the position of individual data points relative to the mean in a universal way.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Probabilities and Z-Tables**:\n",
        "   Once the data is transformed into Z-scores, the **Z-table** (standard normal table) can be used to find probabilities or percentiles for values in a standard normal distribution. This is widely used in hypothesis testing, where you can determine the likelihood that a sample mean falls within a certain range.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
        "   The standard normal distribution plays a key role in **Z-tests** for hypothesis testing. It allows researchers to compare sample data to a population mean and calculate the probability (P-value) that the observed result is due to random chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Central Limit Theorem**:\n",
        "   The **central limit theorem** states that for a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. The standard normal distribution is crucial in this approximation because it allows us to apply Z-tests and confidence intervals when working with sample means.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Confidence Intervals**:\n",
        "   The standard normal distribution is also important for calculating **confidence intervals**. When constructing confidence intervals for population means, we use Z-scores corresponding to a particular confidence level (e.g., 95%, 99%) to determine the range of values where the true population parameter lies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Standard Normal Distribution vs. General Normal Distribution:\n",
        "- The **general normal distribution** can have any mean (μ) and any standard deviation (σ).\n",
        "- The **standard normal distribution** is a special case where μ = 0 and σ = 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, any normally distributed variable can be transformed into the standard normal form using Z-scores, making the standard normal distribution a critical reference for all types of normal distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Using the Standard Normal Distribution:\n",
        "Suppose you want to know the probability that a value from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 falls below 120. First, you would calculate the Z-score for 120:\n",

        "The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is one of the most fundamental concepts in statistics. It states that when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (commonly known as a \"bell curve\"), regardless of the original distribution of the variables. This holds true as the sample size becomes large, typically larger than 30.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Statement of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
        "If you take sufficiently large samples (n ≥ 30) from any population with a finite mean (μ) and a finite variance (σ²), the distribution of the **sample means** will be approximately normally distributed, even if the population itself is not normally distributed.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Normality of Sample Means**:\n",
        "   - The CLT implies that the distribution of the **sample mean** approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. This holds true no matter what the shape of the population distribution is, as long as it has finite variance.\n",
        "   - This is crucial because many statistical methods, including hypothesis testing, Z-tests, and T-tests, assume that the data is normally distributed. The CLT justifies using these methods even when the population distribution is unknown or not normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Foundation for Inferential Statistics**:\n",
        "   - The CLT is the foundation of **inferential statistics**. It allows us to make inferences about population parameters (like the population mean) based on sample statistics (like the sample mean), using tools like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.\n",
        "   - Even if the population distribution is skewed, multimodal, or otherwise non-normal, the CLT ensures that with large enough sample sizes, we can treat the sampling distribution of the mean as normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Simplifies Probability Calculations**:\n",
        "   - Thanks to the CLT, we can apply normal distribution tables (Z-tables) and techniques to approximate probabilities for sums or averages of random variables. This greatly simplifies the analysis of large datasets because normal distribution is well-understood and has been extensively studied.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Enables Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
        "   - In hypothesis testing, the CLT allows us to estimate population parameters from sample statistics and assess the likelihood of observing such data under the null hypothesis. For example, we can perform Z-tests and T-tests with confidence that the sample means will follow a normal distribution for large sample sizes.\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. **Justifies Sample-Based Estimation**:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Formal Statement of the CLT:\n",

        "- Approach a normal distribution as **n** increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Implications:\n",
        "- **Sample Size**: The CLT kicks in for moderately large sample sizes. While 30 is commonly used as a rule of thumb, in cases of extreme skewness or heavy-tailed distributions, a larger sample size may be needed.\n",
        "- **Error Measurement**: The CLT provides a way to measure the **standard error of the mean** (σ/√n), which is a measure of how much variability there is in the sample mean from sample to sample.\n",
        "- **Approximation**: Even for small sample sizes, if the original population is approximately normal, the sample mean distribution will also be approximately normal.\n",

        "### Example of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
        "Suppose we have a population of people's ages, which is right-skewed (most people are young, fewer are older). If we repeatedly take random samples of 50 people and calculate the average age in each sample, the distribution of those sample means will approximate a normal distribution even though the population distribution of ages is skewed.\n",

It simplifies statistical analysis by ensuring that, under large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of the mean is normal, which makes many statistical methods valid and applicable across a wide range of problems."

This is possible because the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate normality, which can then be transformed into the standard normal form.\n",

        "   - The **larger the sample size**, the closer the distribution of the sample means will be to a normal distribution, no matter how skewed or non-normal the population distribution is.\n",

        "**Z-scores** are a useful tool for comparing data points from different distributions, especially when those distributions have different means and standard deviations. Here's how Z-scores facilitate such comparisons:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Standardization Across Distributions**\n",
        "A **Z-score** (or standard score) standardizes individual data points by converting them into a common scale based on the mean and standard deviation of the distribution from which they come. The formula to calculate a Z-score is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\n",
        "Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
        "$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $X$ = the individual data point.\n",
        "- $\\mu$ = the mean of the distribution.\n",
        "- $\\sigma$ = the standard deviation of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "By doing this, the Z-score measures how many standard deviations a given data point $X$ is from the mean $\\mu$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Making Distributions Comparable**\n",
        "Different distributions often have different units, scales, or magnitudes. **Z-scores** allow us to compare data from these distributions directly by converting them into a standardized form:\n",
        "- A **Z-score** of 0 represents a data point that is exactly at the mean of the distribution.\n",
        "- A **positive Z-score** means the data point is above the mean, while a **negative Z-score** means the data point is below the mean.\n",
        "- Z-scores can be used to determine **relative positioning** of data points from different distributions, regardless of the original units of measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Comparing Values from Different Distributions**\n",
        "Imagine you have data points from two different distributions:\n",
        "- **Distribution A** has a mean $\\mu_A = 50$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_A = 10$.\n",
        "- **Distribution B** has a mean $\\mu_B = 100$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_B = 20$.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to compare how exceptional or typical two data points from these distributions are:\n",
        "- Data point $X_A = 60$ from Distribution A.\n",
        "- Data point $X_B = 120$ from Distribution B.\n",

        "Both data points have a **Z-score of 1**, meaning they are both **one standard deviation above the mean** of their respective distributions, despite coming from distributions with different means and standard deviations. This shows that $X_A = 60$ and $X_B = 120$ are similarly positioned in terms of how \"extreme\" they are within their own distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Comparing Relative Extremes**\n",
        "- If a data point from Distribution A has a Z-score of **2** and another data point from Distribution B has a Z-score of **-1**, we can conclude that:\n",
        "  - The data point from Distribution A is more extreme (i.e., two standard deviations above the mean).\n",
        "  - The data point from Distribution B is one standard deviation below the mean, indicating it's less extreme than the other data point, even though both distributions may have completely different means and standard deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Application in Real-World Scenarios**\n",
        "Z-scores are particularly useful in scenarios where data comes from different sources or is measured in different units:\n",
        "- **Education**: Comparing students' test scores across different tests or grading systems. For example, comparing SAT scores to ACT scores.\n",
        "- **Healthcare**: Comparing a patient's test result (e.g., cholesterol level) against a normal population's distribution for risk assessment.\n",
        "- **Finance**: Standardizing returns on investment portfolios to compare performance across different market conditions or periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Z-Scores and Percentiles**\n",
        "Z-scores also allow us to determine how a data point ranks within its distribution. By converting Z-scores to percentiles (using standard normal distribution tables), we can directly compare the relative rank of a data point from one distribution to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- A Z-score of 1.96 corresponds to the **97.5th percentile**, meaning the data point is more extreme than 97.5% of values in its distribution. This comparison holds across any distribution after converting to Z-scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- **Z-scores standardize data**, making it possible to compare data points from different distributions with varying scales and units.\n",
        "- They measure how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of its distribution, allowing for direct comparison of the relative extremeness of values.\n",
        "- Z-scores are commonly used in education, healthcare, finance, and many other fields where comparing relative performance or deviation from the mean is important."

        "The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes how the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. However, the CLT is based on certain assumptions and conditions to hold true. These assumptions are important for ensuring the accuracy and validity of the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Assumptions for Applying the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Independence**:\n",
        "   - The individual observations in the sample must be independent of each other. This means that the selection of one observation should not influence or affect the selection of another.\n",
        "   - In practical terms, this is usually satisfied if the sample is randomly selected or if the sampling is done without replacement from a population that is significantly larger than the sample size.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sample Size**:\n",
        "   - The sample size should be sufficiently large. Although there is no strict rule, a common guideline is that a sample size of **30 or more** is typically considered large enough for the CLT to apply, especially if the population distribution is not too skewed.\n",
        "   - If the population distribution is highly skewed or contains extreme outliers, a larger sample size may be required for the CLT to hold.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Random Sampling**:\n",
        "   - The sample should be a **random sample** from the population. This ensures that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected in the sample, which reduces bias.\n",
        "   - Random sampling helps ensure that the sample is representative of the population, which is essential for the CLT to be applicable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Finite Variance**:\n",
        "   - The population from which the sample is drawn must have a finite variance. The CLT assumes that the population variance $(\\sigma^2)$ exists and is finite.\n",
        "   - If the variance of the population is infinite (which can occur in certain heavy-tailed distributions), the CLT may not hold, and the sample mean may not follow a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Underlying Distribution**:\n",
        "   - The CLT applies regardless of the shape of the underlying population distribution (normal, skewed, uniform, etc.), as long as the sample size is sufficiently large.\n",
        "   - However, for small sample sizes, the CLT does **not** apply if the population distribution is not normal. In this case, the sample mean may not follow a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Considerations:\n",
        "- If the population distribution is **normally distributed**, the CLT applies even for small sample sizes. In this case, the sample mean will follow a normal distribution, regardless of the sample size.\n",
        "- If the population distribution is **not normal** (e.g., skewed, bimodal, etc.), a larger sample size is needed for the sample mean to approach normality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary of Assumptions:\n",
        "- **Independence**: Observations should be independent.\n",
        "- **Large Sample Size**: A sample size of 30 or more is often considered sufficient, but larger sizes are needed for skewed distributions.\n",
        "- **Random Sampling**: The sample should be randomly selected.\n",
        "- **Finite Variance**: The population should have a finite variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By meeting these assumptions, the Central Limit Theorem ensures that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases, which allows statisticians to make valid inferences about population parameters based on sample data."

        "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dataset Generation**:\n",
        "   - A normal distribution is generated using NumPy's `np.random.normal` function. You can adjust the `mean`, `std`, and `size` to generate different datasets. In this example, the default is a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, std = 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Skewness and Kurtosis Calculation**:\n",
        "   - Skewness is calculated using `scipy.stats.skew`, and kurtosis is calculated using `scipy.stats.kurtosis`. By setting `fisher=False`, the function returns Pearson’s kurtosis (normal kurtosis = 3).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visualization**:\n",
        "   - A histogram with a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot is created using Seaborn’s `sns.histplot` to visualize the data distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Skewness**: For a normally distributed dataset, the skewness should be close to 0.\n",
        "- **Kurtosis**: For a normal distribution, kurtosis should be close to 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Skewness: 0.0327\n",
        "Kurtosis: 3.0054\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This indicates that the generated data is very close to a standard normal distribution, with near-zero skewness and kurtosis approximately equal to 3.\n",
        "\n",
