        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts:\n",
        "1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: A statement that assumes no effect or no difference. It represents the status quo or a claim to be tested. For example, \"The mean weight of apples is 100 grams.\"\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)**: A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents the claim that is being tested for possible evidence. For example, \"The mean weight of apples is not 100 grams.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Significance Level (α)**: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A common significance level is 0.05, meaning there's a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is none.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **P-value**: The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than the significance level (α), the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Test Statistic**: A standardized value used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. The type of test statistic (e.g., z-test, t-test) depends on the data and the nature of the test.\n",

        "### Steps in Hypothesis Testing:\n",
        "1. **Formulate Hypotheses**: Define the null (H₀) and alternative (H₁) hypotheses.\n",
        "2. **Choose a Significance Level (α)**: Typically, 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
        "3. **Collect Data and Calculate Test Statistic**: Analyze sample data to compute the test statistic.\n",
        "4. **Determine the P-value or Critical Value**: Compare the test statistic to critical values or use the p-value.\n",
        "5. **Make a Decision**: Based on the p-value and significance level, reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

        "- The null hypothesis is a statement that assumes **no effect**, **no difference**, or **no relationship** between variables in the population.\n",

It represents the probability of making a **Type I error**, which occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected (i.e., a false positive).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points about the Significance Level (α):\n",
        "1. **Definition**:\n",
        "   - The significance level is the **maximum acceptable probability** of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
        "   - Common choices for α include **0.05** (5%), **0.01** (1%), and **0.10** (10%). For example, α = 0.05 means you are willing to accept a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why It's Important**:\n",
        "   - The significance level **controls the risk** of making a Type I error (false positive).\n",

        "   - A **higher significance level** (e.g., α = 0.10) increases the risk of Type I errors but makes it easier to reject H₀.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Decision Rule**:\n",
        "   - In hypothesis testing, once the test statistic (e.g., t-statistic, z-statistic) and the **p-value** (the probability of obtaining the observed results, or more extreme, if H₀ is true) are computed, you compare the **p-value** to the significance level (α).\n",
        "   - If **p-value ≤ α**, you **reject the null hypothesis** (suggesting the evidence is strong enough to conclude that the effect is significant).\n",

        "   - Suppose you're testing whether a new drug is more effective than the standard treatment. You set α = 0.05.\n",

        "   - If the p-value were 0.08, you would **not reject** the null hypothesis, since 0.08 > 0.05, meaning there isn't enough evidence to conclude the drug is more effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Type I and Type II Errors**:\n",
        "   - **Type I Error**: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The probability of this error is **equal to the significance level (α)**.\n",
        "   - **Type II Error**: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. The probability of this error is denoted by **β**, and it is influenced by the significance level, sample size, and effect size.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Choosing a Significance Level:\n",
        "- **α = 0.05** is the most commonly used value, balancing the risk of making Type I and Type II errors.\n",
        "- In **more conservative fields** (like medical research), a lower significance level (e.g., α = 0.01) might be used to minimize the risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",
        "- In **exploratory studies** or situations where errors are less costly, a higher α (e.g., α = 0.10) might be acceptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "The **significance level** is a fundamental part of hypothesis testing because it defines the threshold for deciding whether the evidence against the null hypothesis is strong enough to reject it. It reflects the trade-off between being too cautious (risk of Type I error) and being too lenient in concluding an effect."

        "\n",
        "3. **Threshold for Decision**:\n",

        "5. **Important Considerations**:\n",
        "   - **P-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true**: A common misconception is that the p-value gives the probability that H₀ is true or false. The p-value only indicates how compatible the observed data is with H₀, not the probability of H₀ itself.\n",
        "   - **Small p-values do not measure effect size**: A small p-value indicates statistical significance, but it does not tell you how large or important the observed effect is.\n",
        "   - **Context matters**: The p-value alone cannot determine whether a result is practically meaningful. It's essential to consider the p-value alongside the context, effect size, and study design.\n",

        "\n",
        "A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the population parameter (such as a population mean or proportion) with a specified level of confidence. It provides an estimate of uncertainty around the sample statistic and helps to infer about the population from which the sample was drawn.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Components**:\n",
        "1. **Point Estimate**: The sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) used as a central point in the confidence interval.\n",
        "2. **Margin of Error**: The amount of uncertainty associated with the point estimate, usually determined by the variability in the data and the desired confidence level.\n",
        "3. **Confidence Level**: The probability that the confidence interval will contain the true population parameter. Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a **95% confidence interval** means that if you were to take 100 different samples and compute confidence intervals for each, approximately 95 of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How Confidence Intervals Are Used**:\n",
        "- **To Estimate a Population Parameter**: Instead of just providing a single estimate, a confidence interval provides a range that is more informative. For example, instead of saying the average height of students is 170 cm, a confidence interval would say, \"We are 95% confident that the average height of students is between 168 cm and 172 cm.\"\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **To Assess Uncertainty**: Confidence intervals convey the degree of uncertainty around the sample statistic. A narrow confidence interval suggests more precise estimates, while a wider confidence interval indicates greater uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **To Test Hypotheses**: Confidence intervals are often used to perform hypothesis testing. If the hypothesized value of the population parameter falls outside the confidence interval, it may be rejected at the corresponding confidence level.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Formula for Confidence Interval**:\n",
        "The general formula for a confidence interval for a population mean (with known or large sample size) is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\n",
        "CI = \\overline{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n",

        "Where:\n",
        "-$ \\overline{X} $ = sample mean\n",
        "- $ Z_{\\alpha/2} $ = Z-value corresponding to the confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence)\n",
        "- $ \\sigma $ = population standard deviation (or sample standard deviation if $ \\sigma $ is unknown)\n",
        "- $ n $ = sample size\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example**:\n",
        "Let's say you want to estimate the average height of students in a school. You take a sample of 50 students and calculate the sample mean height to be 170 cm with a standard deviation of 5 cm. To calculate the 95% confidence interval, you would use the Z-value of 1.96 (since it's a 95% confidence level) and plug it into the formula:\n",
        "\n",

        "$\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the 95% confidence interval is between 168.614 cm and 171.386 cm, meaning you are 95% confident that the true average height of all students falls within this range.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Interpreting Confidence Intervals**:\n",
        "1. **Correct Interpretation**: If we say we have a 95% confidence interval of (168.6, 171.4) for the average height, it means that we are 95% confident that the true population mean falls within this interval.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Misinterpretation**: It does **not** mean that 95% of the data falls within this range. The interval applies to the population parameter, not the individual data points.\n",

        "\n",
        "The **F-distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that arises frequently in statistical analysis, particularly in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis. It is named after the statistician Sir Ronald Fisher.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Properties of the F-distribution**:\n",
        "1. **Asymmetry**: The F-distribution is right-skewed, meaning it has a long right tail.\n",
        "2. **Non-negative values**: The distribution only takes non-negative values because the variance is always positive.\n",
        "3. **Two degrees of freedom**: The F-distribution depends on two parameters, the **degrees of freedom** for the numerator $(df_1)$ and the denominator $(df_2)$.\n",
        "4. **Shape changes**: The shape of the distribution varies depending on the degrees of freedom. As the degrees of freedom increase, the distribution becomes more symmetric and resembles the normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **When Is the F-distribution Used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The F-distribution is most commonly used in **hypothesis testing** when comparing two variances or multiple means. Two main applications include:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: ANOVA is used to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.\n",
        "   - **Role of the F-distribution**: The F-distribution is used to calculate the F-statistic in ANOVA, which helps test the null hypothesis that all group means are equal.\n",
        "     - The null hypothesis $(H_0)$: All group means are the same.\n",
        "     - The alternative hypothesis $(H_1)$: At least one group mean is different.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **F-statistic Calculation in ANOVA**:\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Regression Analysis**:\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: In regression analysis, the F-test is used to test the overall significance of a regression model.\n",

        "   - The F-distribution is also used when comparing the variances of two independent populations. For example, in an **F-test for equality of variances**, the F-statistic is calculated as the ratio of the two sample variances:\n",

        "- If the calculated F-statistic exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating significant differences between group means (in ANOVA) or that the regression model is significant (in regression analysis).\n",

        "   - The data in each group should be approximately normally distributed. ANOVA is relatively robust to deviations from normality, especially with large sample sizes, but it is an important assumption for smaller sample sizes.\n",

        "   - This assumption can be tested using Levene's test or Bartlett’s test. If the assumption is violated, alternative methods like Welch’s ANOVA (which doesn't assume equal variances) can be used.\n",

        "### **The F-test**:\n",
        "The **F-test** is a type of statistical test used to determine if there are significant differences between the variances of two or more groups or to compare models' fits. It primarily evaluates whether the variances or group means are significantly different.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Applications of the F-test**:\n",
        "1. **Variance Comparison**: To test if two populations have the same variance.\n",
        "2. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: To test if the means of multiple groups are significantly different.\n",
        "3. **Regression Analysis**: To evaluate the overall significance of a regression model by comparing the explained variance with unexplained variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Concepts of the F-test**:\n",
        "- **F-statistic**: The test statistic calculated as the ratio of two variances:\n",
        "  \\[\n",
        "  F = \\frac{\\text{Variance between groups}}{\\text{Variance within groups}}\n",
        "  \\]\n",
        "  A high F-value indicates that the variance between groups is much larger than the variance within groups, suggesting a significant difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Degrees of Freedom (df)**: The F-test uses two degrees of freedom—one for the numerator (between groups) and one for the denominator (within groups).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: In the context of the F-test:\n",
        "   - For **ANOVA**, the null hypothesis is that all group means are equal (i.e., no difference between groups).\n",
        "   - For **variance comparison**, the null hypothesis is that the variances of the groups are equal.\n",
        "   \n",
        "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:\n",
        "   - In **ANOVA**, the alternative hypothesis is that at least one group mean is different.\n",
        "   - In **variance comparison**, the alternative hypothesis is that the variances are not equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Relation to Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
        "In hypothesis testing, the F-test is used to determine whether to **reject** the null hypothesis. If the F-statistic is larger than the critical value from the F-distribution (based on the chosen significance level, typically 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating significant differences in the means or variances being tested.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example in ANOVA**:\n",
        "In an ANOVA test, the F-test compares the variability between group means (due to the treatment effect) to the variability within groups (due to random variation). The formula for the F-statistic in ANOVA is:\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "F = \\frac{\\text{Mean Square Between (MSB)}}{\\text{Mean Square Within (MSW)}}\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "- If the F-statistic is larger than the critical F-value, it suggests that the group means are not all equal, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example in Regression**:\n",
        "In a regression context, the F-test is used to assess whether the overall regression model is statistically significant. It compares the explained variance (due to the model) with the unexplained variance (due to error). If the F-statistic is large, it suggests that the regression model fits the data well.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Summary**:\n",
        "- The **F-test** is used in multiple contexts to compare variances, means, or models.\n",
        "- It is a crucial tool in **ANOVA** for testing the equality of group means and in **regression** for evaluating the significance of a model.\n",
        "- The test yields an F-statistic that, if large, may indicate that the null hypothesis of no difference should be rejected."

        "    - `sns.histplot`: Plots the histogram of the simulated data with the density estimate (`kde=True`).\n",
        "    - `chi2.pdf`: This function from `scipy.stats` generates the theoretical probability density function (PDF) for the Chi-square distribution with the given degrees of freedom.\n",

        "- **Shape**: The distribution is skewed to the right, especially for small degrees of freedom. As `df` increases, the distribution approaches a normal shape.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Generating Random Data**:\n",
        "   - We generate three groups of random data (`group1`, `group2`, and `group3`), each with different means to simulate different group populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Creating a DataFrame**:\n",
        "   - The groups are combined into a pandas DataFrame, and we use the `pd.melt()` function to reshape it into a long format, suitable for ANOVA.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performing ANOVA**:\n",
        "   - We use the `ols()` function from the **statsmodels** library to fit a linear model (`Value ~ Group`), where \"Value\" is the dependent variable, and \"Group\" is the independent variable.\n",
        "   - The `anova_lm()` function is used to calculate the ANOVA table, which contains information about the F-statistic and p-value.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Interpretation**:\n",
        "   - The **p-value** from the ANOVA test determines whether to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than the significance level (`alpha = 0.05`), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference between the group means.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Generating Random Data**:\n",
        "   - We generate random data for three groups, each with slightly different means and standard deviations to simulate real-world group data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Combining Data**:\n",
        "   - The generated data is combined into a pandas DataFrame. Each group represents one column, and we use `pd.melt()` to reshape the DataFrame into a long format suitable for ANOVA analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performing One-Way ANOVA**:\n",
        "   - We fit a linear model using the **statsmodels** library with the formula `'Value ~ Group'` where \"Value\" is the dependent variable (the observed values) and \"Group\" is the independent variable (the groups).\n",
        "   - The `anova_lm()` function computes the ANOVA table, which includes the F-statistic and the p-value.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Interpreting Results**:\n",
        "   - The p-value helps decide whether to reject the null hypothesis (all group means are equal). If the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is a statistically significant difference between the group means.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Plotting the Results**:\n",
        "   - A **boxplot** is used to visualize the distributions of values in each group. The plot shows the spread, median, and any potential outliers for each group, which helps in comparing the group means visually.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Output:\n",

        "   - The `Values` column represents the response variable influenced by the combination of `Factor_A` and `Factor_B`.\n",

        "   - The formula `'Values ~ C(Factor_A) * C(Factor_B)'` specifies that both factors and their interaction should be considered.\n",

        "   - We use **Seaborn's pointplot** to visualize the interaction between the two factors. The plot shows how the means of `Values` change across different levels of `Factor_A` and `Factor_B`.\n",

        "2. **F-Distribution**:\n",
        "   - The F-distribution is right-skewed, with a long tail to the right. It is used to compare variances in hypothesis testing.\n",
        "   - The shape of the F-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom for the numerator and the denominator.\n",

        "### Role of the F-Distribution in Hypothesis Testing:\n",
        "\n",

        "  \n",
        "- **Null Hypothesis**: In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis typically states that all group means are equal (in the case of ANOVA) or that variances are equal (in the case of F-tests). The F-distribution helps determine whether observed variances differ significantly from expected variances under the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",

        "2. **Performing the One-Way ANOVA**:\n",
        "   - We use the `f_oneway()` function from the `scipy.stats` library to perform the one-way ANOVA. This function calculates the F-statistic and the P-value.\n",
        "   - The **null hypothesis** in ANOVA states that the means of all groups are equal. If the P-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference between at least one pair of group means.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Boxplot Visualization**:\n",
        "   - Boxplots are used to visualize the distribution of data within each group and compare the medians and spread of the groups.\n",
        "   - If the ANOVA test finds a significant difference (P-value < 0.05), the boxplots provide a visual way to assess where those differences may lie.\n",

        "   - We generate a random sample from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 5. The sample size is 30.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hypothesized Population Variance**:\n",
        "   - The null hypothesis assumes that the population variance is 25 (i.e., $sigma_0^2 = 25$, which is the square of the standard deviation 5).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sample Variance**:\n",
        "   - We calculate the sample variance using `np.var()` with `ddof=1` to get the unbiased estimator of the variance (Bessel's correction).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Chi-square Statistic**:\n",
        "   - The Chi-square test statistic is calculated based on the sample variance, population variance, and sample size.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **P-value**:\n",
        "   - We compute the p-value for the two-tailed test using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Decision Rule**:\n",
        "   - If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is significant evidence that the population variance is different from the hypothesized value.\n",
